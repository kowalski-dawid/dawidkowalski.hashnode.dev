Hi,

my name is Dawid Kowalski and welcome to \[[Jackass](https://youtu.be/X8_9eYfpQ9w?si=WALPd6hJ07mL1JaR)\] my first professional blog ever. I have no clue how to go about this so, follow along and watch me fail spectacularly while I learn.

## A Narcissistic Autobiographical Note for Starters.

A little background on me, I was born by accident in 1986, developed a deep interest in music, reading and technology, as my dad had a massive collection of [New Wave of British Heavy Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_of_British_heavy_metal) and [Thrash Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal) music, while his dad (i.e. my grandfather) had a a massive collection of deeply interesting books spanning from wacky UFOs, [New Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_age), [occultism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultism), and other things I do not believe in, albeit I find it amusing and interesting to watch how people try to make sense of reality. Good thing, my grandfather also had plenty of serious and dense books on factual and scientifically proven phenomena such as [Lucid Dreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream), [meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation) or deeply religious, philosophical, and symbolic books, such as the [Tibetan Book of the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo_Thodol) which I had been too young to read. But I have read it, anyways.

I became interested in technology in 1991, when I was five as my dad decided it would be and amazing idea to get me a [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) which was a pretty hot piece of hardware back in the day. I also clearly remember him learning to code in [Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC), which was not surprising as he has always been tech-savvy and well-versed in electronics. One of the best memories from that period was him writing a software which displayed a birthday cake and played a tune using the computer’s [SID Chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6581). That’s when I realized that I really wanted to become a programmer. Unfortunately, I always sucked at math.

The rest of my childhood was not that bright, and I needed an escape, so I would just lose myself in reading and composing music, while also failing at attempts in programming; I was super interested in the so-called [Demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene), i.e. creative programming at the verge of IT and art.

I finally settled with listening to and producing music, reading books, writing, watching films and organizing live music events.

## Professional Career

I started my professional career public administration and EU project management back in 2009 at the [Swietokrzyskie Voivodeship Office](https://www.kielce.uw.gov.pl/en) in my hometown of [Kielce, Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kielce).

At the time, I was responsible for developing a draft grant proposal for a project funded under the [Swiss-Polish Cooperation Programme](https://www.eda.admin.ch/schweizerbeitrag/en/home/news/news.html/content/schweizerbeitrag/en/meta/news/2023/kooperationsprogramm_schweiz-polen) with a total value of CHF 20M, quite a lot, huh? Especially for a 23-year-old intern with zero self-esteem and poor math skills. I was responsible for drafting the initial budget, project proposal, procedures, processes and so on and so on \[[insert Zizek spitting](https://youtu.be/B0c2LjKdqqw?si=Qvkh4hMj6VRpwdpj)\]. Quite a challenging task, required me to learn how to prioritize task, work in a particularly stiff and formal environment, but also allowed me to witness the rotten side of politics.

After 12 years of working there I went to Brussels, Belgium for a brief internship at one of the Polish MPs offices at the [European Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en). I *noped* outta there, too much politics makes Dave a dull boy.

In 2018 I started a sole entrepreneurship Soon after, I transitioned to another administrative position in a town of [Skarzysko-Kamienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skar%C5%BCysko-Kamienna) in Poland, where I landed a job at the [Investor Service Centre](https://coi.skarzysko.pl/www/) where I was responsible for managing a [Technology Incubator](https://sit.skarzysko.pl/), which was technically a large warehouse space for various startups. An interesting job, but it got too politically charged at some point, and I decided to leave. The Investor Service Centre is now defunct because guess what? Politics.

In 2018 I also started a sole enterprise called [EnglishCloud](https://www.linkedin.com/company/18407373/), since I studied Linguistics/English Philology, and I have always been interested in Anglo-Saxon culture. I did translations and interpreting for a couple of years until the market started dying, later I moved to On-line ESL teaching, which was a good gig, but I did not enjoy the formalities required by schools, and I have also noticed that some of the students preferred to have 1:1 classes with me, since schools tend to record classes, which people found intimidating, plus it forced a very stiff atmosphere, while most of my private clients prefer loose conversations and it seems to be working so much better than formalized teaching. I still teach ESL for general and special purposes, such as European Union language, business lingo, etc. One of my greatest achievements in that area was doing private lectures for a manager at the [Polish Ministry of Finance](https://www.gov.pl/web/finance) and now I am about to start a series of courses for the employees of [The Polish Financial Supervision Authority](https://www.knf.gov.pl/en/), neat for a shy emo kid, huh? My greatest achievement as a translator is the ongoing cooperation with [Kielce University of Technology](https://international.tu.kielce.pl/), as translating scientific papers published by international journals is quite a challenge, not only because of the complexity of the subject matter, but also because various scientific journals have their own, rigorous requirements. It’s a challenge, and each successful publication is a small victory.

In 2023 I got a job at a Polish IT company called [Britenet sp. z o.o.](https://britenet.eu/), as a European Union Tender Researcher, as the company is one of the main providers of IT solutions for the Polish Government and wanted to expand their reach. I stayed there for a year, but decided to call it quits to focus on my sole enterprise, but I also had my sights set on [Technical Writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_writing). It seemed like the perfect job for me - related to IT, working with documents, intellectually challenging, as it required me to learn plenty of new things which I will be describing in detail in later posts.

In October of 2024 I took up Technical Communication postgraduate studies at [Vistula University](https://vistula.edu.pl/en/educational-offers/postgraduate-studies) in Warsaw, Poland.

In February of 2025 I somehow got hired by [Catalogic Software](https://www.catalogicsoftware.com/) at their Polish branch in Warsaw and well, now I am a full-time Technical Writer.

And to be honest, this place feels like home for multiple reasons.

I will be documenting my progress on this blog, but I’ll also try to share as much knowledge about Tech Writing as possible.

## Summary

My tenure as a civil servant cultivated expertise in securing grants and managing projects, skills that serendipitously laid the groundwork for my subsequent career change.

My path to technical writing wasn’t abrupt, but rather a gradual progression. My experience with official documents and EU regulations instilled in me the importance of clear communication and organized information, which are fundamental to successful technical writing. Moving from the civil service to the translation and localization field revealed my enthusiasm for simplifying complex information for wider understanding.

My academic journey provided the essential groundwork for this shift. My roots in English Philology from [Jan Kochanowski University of Kielce](https://en.ujk.edu.pl/), coupled with my MA from the [University College of Social Sciences in Częstochowa](https://ucss.eu/), equipped me with the linguistic skills necessary for this new path. I deepened my expertise through postgraduate studies in translation studies at the renowned [Jagiellonian University in Kraków](https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start). I learned a lot about [document accessibility](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/make-your-word-documents-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities-d9bf3683-87ac-47ea-b91a-78dcacb3c66d) and became pretty skilled in using [Adobe Creative Suite](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjB4bjOp-CLAxWDlYMHHdquCCsYABADGgJlZg&co=1&ase=2&gclid=Cj0KCQiA8fW9BhC8ARIsACwHqYqg8yqmpBJrvgfibPKeiERsd-rH3E8tlY2TGb5KRefDV0fRqYj9GyQaAranEALw_wcB&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESVuD2r0vex293JvahJzR72oO2fzFo7OV8CPn_oRsWOfaWy2_kgttgV-_rFTSWjFeLicFBj0pd2H9z_8L4xu5i89a_eQiiy52WpuvtGhWVrDYQAPLtjP8-&sig=AOD64_0At4tMZ5aKK90M41XGGH4mNgR5Tg&q&nis=4&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjfqrTOp-CLAxWSRPEDHV2nNMAQ0Qx6BAhBEAE) after finishing a course in [DTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing) at [IT Media Training Center](https://itmedia.pl/) in Warsaw, the only Adobe Education Elite Partner in Poland back in 2022.

At this point, I am working on my [diploma project](https://github.com/kowalski-dawid/Eurorack_Synthesizers_for_Dummies) in Technical Communication at Vistula University.

Today, I combine my public administration experience with technical writing expertise to create documentation that bridges the gap between complex systems and the people who use them.

My fluency in English and Polish, along with DTP certification and proficiency in various [CAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_translation) tools, [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)s allows me to work across linguistic and cultural boundaries.

This blog chronicles my professional metamorphosis and shares insights from both worlds. I’ll explore best practices in technical writing, lessons learned from public administration that apply to documentation, and practical advice for those considering a similar career transition.

When I’m not crafting technical documents or writing blog posts, I'm feeding my curiosity through travel, diving into non-fiction books, exploring topics in clinical psychology, or losing myself in music.

Join me as I document this continuing journey and share what I’ve learned along the way.

Yours truly,

[Dawid Kowalski](http://linktr.ee/dawidkowalski)
